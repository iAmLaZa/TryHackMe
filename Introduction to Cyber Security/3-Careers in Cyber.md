Cyber security careers are becoming more in demand and offer high salaries. There are many different jobs within the security industry, from offensive pentesting (hacking machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to defensive security (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).

# Why get a career in cyber:

High Pay - jobs in security have high starting salaries
Exciting - work can include legally hacking systems or defending against cyber attacks
Be in demand - there are over 3.5 million unfilled cyber positions
This room helps you break into cyber security by providing information about various cyber security roles; it also links to different learning paths that you can use to start building your cyber skills.

# Security analysts 

are integral to constructing security measures across organisations to protect the company from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

Responsibilities
	
	Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
	
	Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
	
	Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.


# Security engineers

 develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

Responsibilities

	Testing and screening security measures across software

	Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities

	Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security


# Incident responders

 respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.

Responsibilities

	Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan

	Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures

	Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents


# A malware analyst's
 work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

Responsibilities

	Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering

	Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment

	Document and report all the findings

You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

Responsibilities
	Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
	
	Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
	
	Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention


# Red teamers
 share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

Responsibilities
	Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection

	Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures

	Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
