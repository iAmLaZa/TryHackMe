Nice work! This room was quite theory-heavy and covered quite a range of the fundamentals in getting you familiar with Linux. To quickly recap, this room taught you:

How to connect to a Linux machine remotely using SSH
Advancing your use of commands by providing flags, switches and where you can go to learn about these for each command (man pages)
Some more commands that you'll frequently be using to interact with the filesystem and its contents
A brief introduction to file permissions & switching users
A summary paragraph of the important root directories on a Ubuntu Linux install and how we may be able to use the data stored within these.
I encourage you to go through this room again once or twice to gain some familiarity with the concepts. After all, practice makes perfect!
